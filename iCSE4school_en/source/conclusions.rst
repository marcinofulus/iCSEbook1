How to successfully implement the methodology
=============================================

Implementation of the presented project under Polish education
circumstances, consultation with the academic community as well as the
conducted evaluation allowed us to draw conclusions about the
implementation conditions elaborated in the methodology. In order to
identify strengths and weaknesses as well as opportunities and threats
regarding the possibility of implementing the project in school
practice, a SWOT analysis of the success of the project was carried
out. It was formulated on the basis of the joint experience of the
project participants, the analysis of the conditions of the local
school environment and the external educational environment. We have
identified a number of factors that influence the potential success of
the project, understood as the implementation of the methodology
developed within the project in such a way that it becomes a permanent
element in the classroom.  Although SageMath is a very useful tool in
high school, it is very poorly popularized. It is clear from the
evaluation questionnaires that pupils had not heard of him
before. They have not heard of SageMath as well. Our actions under
this project are designed to change this situation.

It will not be hard for students to be interested in students because
they are embedded in the world of computer and information
technology. They do not have any worries about it, they are familiar
with new applications. These included interviews, evaluation
questionnaires and the experiences of project teachers.

According to an evaluation study, 80% of students rated SageMath very
well. Students found the SageMath tools very useful, emphasized
SageMath on-line availability, intuitive commands, lots of online
resources, help with home-work, advanced learning, and interest
development.

However, in order for the student to be able to use the SageMath
tools, the teacher should be familiar with the student's curiosity and
motivation to use SageMath. In turn, for a teacher to have the ability
to use the tools SageMath, should also be curious, motivated and
convinced. Based on the experience of the teachers who took part in
the project and who had not heard of SageMath before, we know that
they have rated the highly usefulness of SageMath to teach their
subject. The interviews highlighted the benefits of SageMath as free
software, available online, with the ability to work on their own
server, where you can save work, publish materials and evaluate
student work. They have recognized the potential of SageMath to use in
school and beyond school education, including the ability to: quickly
perform multiple-parameter calculations, graphically present results,
facilitate understanding of the topic, deepen problem analysis,
explore content beyond the curriculum, tools for learner
self-education, preparation for the subject competitions. Teachers
also considered SageMath a very good tool for formulating
generalizations based on a rapid study of multiple input problems,
problem solving for many cases, quick validation of solutions,
classroom preparation and classroom exercises, workshops and
competitions.

But to say so about SageMath, teachers first had to go through the way
of learning new software. It is known that "beginnings are
difficult" - teachers frequently repeat it to the
students. Ultimately, the time needed for SageMath was estimated by
teachers to be around 10 hours and they did not find the software very
difficult to learn. These statements, reviewed during the evaluation,
suggest that the teachers who met SageMath expressed very positive
opinions including the belief that SageMath would apply to both their
needs and their extra-curricular and extra-curricular activities.  And
what about the teachers who did not touch the software themselves and
only heard about it (for example, directly at the interview)? The case
does not look so positive because the unknown does not inspire
confidence. Although the attitude of curiosity - about 60% and
skepticism - was about 20%, but also a large group of opponents -
about 20%. The last ones do not want to spend time on new
technologies, they are the supporters of calculations on the paper,
they believe that the student will lose interest in the problem, since
immediately can have a result. Among curious teachers were people
interested in innovation, career advancement, active teaching methods,
people worried about losing hours in connection with reform, people
wishing to change schools to higher and above all younger ones. So
this is the target group of teachers we are trying to reach in our
publications, conferences, and dissemination of the results of the
project.

An extremely important group from the point of view of the
implementation conditions of the project results is also the external
educational environment of the teacher. So, firstly, other teachers
working in the same school. Among them are science-related teachers,
IT teachers, or teachers who, through their participation in training,
conferences or self-education, can encourage their colleagues to apply
new technologies.

Another circle of the environment is the school's management, which
has a huge impact on motivating teachers for professional development,
such as developing their curriculum, developing innovation,
participating in training, applying active and innovative teaching
methods - using new technology, subject competition organization or
individual work of gifted student.

The next very important element are the methodological consultants. As
part of their mission, they organize methodological meetings,
workshops, consultations, or information carriers, and will certainly
be interested in using new technologies from which SageMath is a great
example. We took care to invite consultants to the conferences
organized under the project. Going forward, we announced our teachers'
training centers. SageMath is definitely worth the price of training
and we will be looking forward to it. Many teachers will be interested
in such training. Our evaluation studies have shown this. Teachers who
heard of SageMath were interested in this tool, asked whether there
are courses in this field and admitted that they prefer to complete
the course rather than independently learn new software.

A good time to implement our project is the time of reform, which is
beieng implemented now in Poland, when teachers are no longer able to
sleep peacefully, some will go to another school, others will face new
employment conditions, and everyone will face the new program. So you
have to be competitive. Good opportunity to dust off old habits, for
example in the form of introducing new teaching methods, introducing
innovation, creating a circle for "capable" or other activity. So
teachers will be interested, there will be a lot of training for
computer science teachers, promised by the Ministry of Education, will
also regulate increasing the hours for the strict subjects (for
computer science in particular), both in primary school and high
school. It is a very good perspective to implement the results of this
project.

By answering the question, "What conditions must be met to succeed,"
we have followed the path that information needs to be communicated
about how the road can reach the teacher, and what factors will
influence the success of the implementation of the results of our
project. We asked the following questions:

Teacher -> Where do you find out information about SageMath? ->
popularization of methodology in the media, conferences, other
teacher, the offer of the training center, subject methodology, how
will you find it worth? -> Show SageMath opportunities, workshops,
teacher motivation for activity, openness, encouragement from another
teacher or methodology, school management, reform and related change
of work, reform and related curriculum changes. How to learn?
self-education, demonstration eg computer science teacher, course,
conference, publication Where will the classes take place? - if he has
access to a computer lab, he / she may use the student's smartphones?
What will he use? -> will choose from the curriculum content, which
co-operation with teachers of the subject, innovation, projects,
competitions, circle, work with a gifted student, preparing students
for the subject competitions.

Headmaster -> Encourage,, Send to the course?  Methodology/Subject
Consultants-> will they come to the conference, will they popularize?
Teacher Training Centers -> Does anybody know about SageMath, will
they accept the conference invitation, or will they arrange a course?
Ministry of Education -> Will the SageMath deployment be adequate in
the network? - yes, the teacher has to implement a compulsory core
curriculum, and the extension is planned by himself (possibly in
agreement with the subject group) and has hours, because the program
is general, the teacher himself develops the content and topics.

Will the curriculum be flexible? Under Polish education circumstances
the syllabus is selected by teacher himself (possibly in the agreement
with the school subject team). He chooses (for a given subject) a set
of ready-made programs approved by the Ministry of Education or he /
she develops himself as an author program (only for the approval of
the Pedagogical Board at the school). So it all depends on the teacher
!!
