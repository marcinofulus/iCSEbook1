About iCSE4school project
-------------------------




Contemporary forms of use mathematical and natural sciences elements
of information and communication technology in the work of a teacher
is not only a legal obligation, but above all to diversify the
lesson. A modern teacher can not imagine work without the use of
modern information technology. Up-to-the-minute need is to improve
their computer programming skills and programming languages. In
everyday school work, the teacher uses computer technology primarily
to create a variety of utility tests, diagnoses, research tools and
surveys. With specialized commercial software, create invitations,
posters, school informers and create lesson plans or school events.

Thanks to computer technology documentation of teachers' activities is
conducted transparently, aesthetically and legibly. The own workplace
is organized and continuously refined, also through the use of
e-learning applications and programs or school-based software. All
these programs and applications are characterized by a relatively
intuitive and simple relationship to their method of construction, and
therefore no change or performance in them other than those enabled by
the manufacturer. From both the teacher's and the learner's point of
view, it is equally important to address the problems identified in
the core curriculum and beyond. A teacher who studies the core issues
of subjects such as physics and chemistry encounters a lot of content,
which requires the use of a complex account with elements of
mathematical analysis. Commonly known methods of education include
providing without demonstrating a relationship describing a given
phenomenon or presenting graphs of the discussed relations without
presenting equations describing the transformed curves. For a student
who expects a full explanation of a given phenomenon and its
interpretation, this is one of the most important obstacles in the
assimilation and in the connection of theoretical considerations with
the mathematical interpretation. Most applications of information
technology in teaching come down to data retrieval or their
introduction and automated processing. The programming language
environment of Python and Sage is the release of the subject from the
imposed constraints and the programming skills acquired by the learner
during the learning process effectively develop his or her ability to
conclude and evaluation during the above process.

The use of the proposed programming environment brings down complex
dependencies and equations from the academic level to a level not
exceeding the applicable science curriculum and is fully endorsed and
recommended as a work tool by both the Polish Ministry of National
Education and the Polish Ministry of Digitization.

The proposed methodology is the output of activities related to the
"Computing in high school science education - icse4school" project
implemented in 2014-2017 under the Erasmus Program, Action 2 of the
Strategic Partnership. The project was implemented in international
cross-sectoral cooperation, including higher education institutions
(University of Silesia in Katowice, University of Augsburg, Simula
School of Research and Innovation), 2 high schools (2 AZSO in Chorzów
and 117 ZS - XXXIII in Warsaw) and NGO Foundation for the Development
of the Silesian Interdisciplinary Center for Education and
Interdisciplinary Studies - EDU RES.  The main objective was to
develop in a transnational consortium a methodology integrated with
computer science of mathematics and physics in high schools on the
basis of the pilot program in selected schools.  The subject of the
project was to teach Python programming using the Sage environment and
use this skill to solve problems related to mathematics, physics, and
computer science. The project was addressed to students of high
schools.  The need for ICSE4school project was due to the growing
interest in programming and the knowledge gathered showing the lack of
information on one of the most widely used Python programming
languages. In addition, the observations of teachers - both academic
and classroom leaders with extended curriculum in mathematics,
computer science and physics in high schools indicated the
helplessness of students and students in applying information
technology and numerical methods in solving problems on the borderline
of scientific issues.

Using our materials and without basic skills in Python programming is
in large extent possible, but, we recommend that you start by learning
the language and the SageMath environment available at
SageMath.org. In the Sage environment, the student has the
opportunity, apart from programming, to do exercises on the sample
materials contained there, with the possibility of modifying the
source texts.

The scripts developed in the project using Python are recommended for
use in a variety of ways, depending on the needs and capabilities of
students and teachers. Thus, they can be used directly during class
activities or in the form of workshops, provided that the number of
teaching hours is at the teacher's disposal. Materials or parts can
also be used in home work using the innovative "flipped teaching"
method, where pupils in homework analyze the underlying
knowledge. This is a new topic and the lesson is devoted to
consolidating and deepening the acquired knowledge and skills (as
opposed to the classical methods whereby the basic knowledge is
introduced during the lesson and the self-development of the material
is done at home). Finally, our materials can be used to explore and
broaden the knowledge and skills of students and students with special
educational needs (gifted students and those who have the need for
self-development or who need to use numerical methods for solving
problems using a publicly accessible tool) learn outside the school
for self-study, as well as by all those who are interested in
repetition, consolidation and extension of knowledge.

The lesson scenarios from the iCSE4school project can also be used to
work with students with less potential in the arts by presenting
pieces of our materials by teachers, as well as in the form of
workshop work, where students modify the source texts themselves,
watching the effects of these changes and formulating appropriate
conclusions. This way of using materials not only creates
opportunities for teachers and young people, but also effectively uses
classroom scenarios using Python in working with younger learners at
earlier stages of education.

The materials from the iCSE4school project can be used in e-learning,
blended-learning, and m-learning, using computers or other devices (eg
smartphones, tablets); with access to the internet or off-line.

During the project students and teachers from two highschools worked
on SageMath servers. They have created almost 3000 documents, some of
them have been "published" and can be viewed:

        -  `<https://sage01.icse.us.edu.pl/pub/>`_
        -  `<https://sage03.icse.us.edu.pl/pub/>`_


Observing the students' efforts to create simple programs using Python
to solve a problem during project implementation has confirmed the
great potential of individualizing their work. The individually
tailored level of individual needs, the pace of work, and the
individual teacher's help influence the development of each
student. An important factor in mobilizing pupils for action and
learning is also the recent need for learning programming (coding) and
awareness of the significant shortage of people able to program in the
labor market. By encouraging the use of didactic materials developed
in the iCSE4school project, we invite you to comment.
